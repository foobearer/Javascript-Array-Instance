# Javascript Array Instances
Searching for Array elements using JavaScript Array Instance.

# Introduction
Why waste time writing long for loops if you can use Instance methods. This will make our code shorter and will clearly state our intention. For loops will surely do the same but it would sometimes make our code ambiguous to read and harder to maintain.
I have segregated the methods into groups to make things easier to grasp. The first group will return one element when the condition is passed while the second group will return all instances.
